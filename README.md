## Work in Progress! ðŸš§
- there are some unfinished features I am still working on with this project (see below)

# Tents & Trails
A campground review site usuing the MERN stack. Users (AKA my friends) can share/recommend different backcountry routes in Algonquin Park. 

# How to Use
1. Use "npm i" in the client and server folders to install all dependencies needed
2. Use "npm run dev" to run the client side 
3. Use "node app.js" to run the server side


# Future Developments
âœ” user submission feedback  
- image upload
- Login route & authentication 
- authorization - users can only modify posts they authored/submitted 
- add reviews feature
- unit testing 
- automatic sign out
- search/filter feature
