## Work in Progress! 🚧

- there are some unfinished features I am still working on with this project (see below)

# Tents & Trails

A campground review site usuing the MERN stack. Users (AKA my friends) can share/recommend different backcountry routes in Algonquin Park.

# How to Use

1. Use "npm i" in the client and server folders to install all dependencies needed
2. Use "npm run dev" to run the client side
3. Use "node app.js" to run the server side

# Future Developments

✔ user submission feedback  
✔ migrate data to mongoDB atlas

- add reviews feature
- image upload
- Login route & authentication
- authorization - users can only modify posts they authored/submitted
- unit testing
- automatic sign out

Next Steps
✔ steup review form component
✔ setup action & extract review form data
submit extracted data to backend
display data on camp details page
